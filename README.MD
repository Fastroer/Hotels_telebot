# Technical Details

The bot is written in Python using the Telegram Bot API and the SQLite database. It uses the python-telegram-bot library to interact with the Telegram Bot API and the sqlite3 library to interact with the database.

The bot consists of two main functions:

    1. main_function(message): This function handles the hotel search and filtering based on the user's input.

    2. func(message): This function handles the other commands and messages that the user sends to the bot.

The bot also uses several helper functions to interact with the database and perform various tasks such as sending messages, processing dates, and handling user input.

# How to Run

To run the bot, you will need to:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Create a new bot on Telegram and obtain the API token.
4. Create a new SQLite database.
5. Modify the config.py file to include your API token and database information.
6. Run the bot using python main.py.

# Future Improvements

Some potential improvements to the bot could include:
1. Adding more filtering criteria for hotel search results.
2. Improving the user interface and adding more interactive elements.
3. Adding support for multiple languages.
4. Adding support for searching for flights and other travel-related information.
